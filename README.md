# Project Title

Predicting Article Helpfulness on Wikihow

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the helpfulness percentage of articles on Wikihow, a popular website known for its vast collection of how-to guides. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the helpfulness of an article based on various features and attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of a large collection of articles from Wikihow, along with corresponding information about their helpfulness percentage, and other relevant features.

## Requirements
The following libraries and tools are required to run this project:

Python (version 3.9.x)
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
LightGBM
CatBoost

## Methodology

The project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationship between different variables. Various visualization techniques and statistical analyses are employed to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. This EDA process helps in understanding the characteristics of the dataset and aids in feature selection for the predictive modeling phase.

The predictive modeling phase involves developing a machine learning model to predict the helpfulness percentage of articles. Different algorithms can be explored and evaluated for their performance. Additionally, feature engineering techniques can be applied to extract meaningful features from the text content or other available data.

## Results

The project's focus primarily lies on the exploratory data analysis and understanding the dataset rather than solely emphasizing the final predictive results. The obtained insights from the EDA phase can provide valuable information about the factors influencing article helpfulness and help guide content creators in improving the quality and relevance of their articles.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aims to analyze and predict the helpfulness percentage of articles on Wikihow. Through extensive exploratory data analysis and utilizing various machine learning techniques, we strive to gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to article helpfulness. The findings from this project can be leveraged to enhance article quality and provide a better user experience for Wikihow's audience.
